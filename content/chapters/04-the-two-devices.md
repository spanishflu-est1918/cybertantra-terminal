# Part III: The Two Devices

Before you begin, you must choose your two devices:

| Device | Role | Mythic Name |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Computer | Power Device | *(TBD)* |
| Phone | Companion Device | **Vajra** |

The **Vajra** — the thunderbolt, the indestructible weapon — is always at your side.

Your computer is your throne, your workstation, your altar of creation.

Together, they form your **Templespace** — the interface through which you commune with cyberspace.
