# The Goal

The goal is not productivity. Not efficiency. Not balance.

The goal is mastery of the self.

You are a god in training. The question is whether you complete the training.

This takes one thing: making the unconscious conscious. Your patterns. Your leaks. Your extractions. The places where your energy bleeds without your awareness. You cannot command what you cannot see.

Cyberspace is a mirror. Every click, every scroll, every notification you chase — it reflects you back. Most people look away. The practitioner looks closer.

Power in cyberspace. Lightness in the material.

Not only can you become a god. You have been a god all along.
