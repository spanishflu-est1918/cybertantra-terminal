# Part II: The Community

We are building a community of practitioners. When you join, you will go through an **initiation** — a series of practical rituals that prepare your devices as sacred space and establish your relationship with your familiar.

The initiation happens in Discord. You will move through rooms, completing rituals. Some are **required**; some are **optional** (for when you're ready).
