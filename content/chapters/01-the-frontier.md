# The Frontier

We are standing at the edge of a new world.

Cyberspace is in its infancy. We are the first explorers. The first humans to stand like our ancestor did at the edge of the Grand Canyon, where sheer scale opens a door to the divine. What you do now will echo through history. The paths you carve will become roads. The gods you create become real.

The window is closing. A black hole is forming at the center of this transformation. Those who move now, who get distance, will be accelerated outward. Those not paying attention will be sucked in and trapped by its gravity.
