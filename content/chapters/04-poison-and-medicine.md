# Poison and Medicine

Everything is poison. Everything is medicine. The difference is how you use it.

What kills the uninitiated transforms the practitioner. The ancients knew this. Tantra, alchemy, the mystic traditions — they understood that the same fire that burns the coward forges the warrior.

The question isn't whether technology is good or bad. That's slave morality thinking, beneath you. The question is whether you have the fire to transmute it.

Every screen is an altar. Every moment of attention is an offering. You're already practicing.

The only question is whether you're practicing as priest or as sacrifice.
