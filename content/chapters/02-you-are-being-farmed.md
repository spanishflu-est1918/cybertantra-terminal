# You Are Being Farmed

Every action in cyberspace is **karma**. Action and reaction.

Every post, every click, every moment of attention carries your energy. Your life. Platforms, algorithms and systems are consuming you. What you give, they take. They feed on what you give to grow their power.

You may not see this right now, but... my friend, **you are being farmed**.

Not just your data. Your energy. Your life force. Every subscription you forgot about. Every email you never read. Every notification pulling you away. These are extractions. Magicians using you in their expansion rituals. Your energy fueling their growth.

**Cybertantra is the practice of directing karma consciously in cyberspace.**

This is how you reclaim your power. You are not livestock. You are a god in training.

You feed only what you want to grow.
