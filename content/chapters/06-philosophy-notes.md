# Part V: Philosophy Notes

## On Blue Light

Reject the dogma. Electronics are not divorced from the sacred.

Looking at your yantra by night or morning is permitted. Talk to your familiar first thing — this is practice, not sin.

Blue light is **sattvic** — you might need it, you might not. We teach lighting customization.

**Your job**: track effects on your own psyche and wellbeing. The guilt is imposed by naysayers. Observe for yourself.

## On Monitoring the Situation

Set up automated alerts for what matters to you. Dive deep into topics of interest.

Be one with the **zeitgeist** — the spirit of the times — if you choose.

## On Horror Vacui

You cannot live in a messed up room. The same applies to your devices.

Your devices are your weapons in this age.
